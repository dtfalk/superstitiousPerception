            <p>In this task you will be shown a series of squares which contain a pattern of black and white pixels. </p>
            <p>In half of the trials, a black <b>H</b> will be present in the pattern. You will be asked to determine whether or not the <b>H</b> is in the image.
            It will be very difficult to make this determination, but trust your intuition. The <b>H</b> will not be obvious, but it is always centered, and you will be shown an image of the <b>H</b> for reference before you begin.</p>
            
            <p>For each image, please press <b>Y</b> if you see the <b>H</b> and press <b>N</b> if you do not see the <b>H</b>.</p>
            
            <p>Remember, you will be better at this task than you think.</p>
